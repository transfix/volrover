# grl_snam_austin_drive.py — VolRover3 showcase example: a vehicle patrols REAL
# Austin, TX geometry in a LIVE volrover3 window, GROUNDED — it drives the STREETS
# (routed around the buildings, draped on the terrain), filmed by a low
# third-person chase camera. A good demo of what volrover3 + the embedded Python
# scene bridge can do today.
#
# It loads a geometry_bundle (terrain heightfield + glTF city mesh) — by default the
# CVC-DBG "austin_south" bundle (3 km x 3 km around the UT campus) — rasterizes the
# buildings into an occupancy grid, plans a grounded patrol loop through the free
# space (streets), drapes it on the real terrain, and follows the vehicle with a
# position-driven chase camera + terrain-normal vehicle orientation.
#
# NOTE ON PATH FINDING: the route here is planned with a plain A*/occupancy-grid
# heuristic (pycvc_gl.scenes.plan_ground_route) — it is NOT yet a learned/
# physics-informed planner. Swapping in the GRL-SNAM navigator is the next step;
# this example shows the live-scene + driving + camera plumbing it will feed.
#
# SETUP: this example needs only the volrover3 embedded env — pycvc / pycvc_gl (the
# scene helpers ship as pycvc_gl.camera / .vehicle / .lab / .scenes), numpy, and the
# vtk-python wrappers — plus the scene assets on disk. It does NOT depend on GRL-SNAM.
#   * the austin_south bundle on disk; override its path with GRL_SNAM_SCENE_BUNDLE.
#
# RUN: Python Console -> Jobs tab -> "Load Script..." -> "Run as Job" (the glTF is
# ~978k triangles, so the first tick takes several seconds to load + rasterize).
#
# ATTRIBUTION: the geometry is derived from OpenStreetMap (c) OpenStreetMap
# contributors, ODbL (https://openstreetmap.org/copyright); SRTM terrain is US
# public domain. Credit OpenStreetMap in any published render.
#
# LAYERING: volrover3 does NOT depend on GRL-SNAM (or on the CVC-DBG assets). This
# runs under volrover3's generic job runner when GRL-SNAM is installed and the
# bundle is present.
